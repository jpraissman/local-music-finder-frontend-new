                As we grow this community, posting events to
                TheLocalMusicFinder.com will be free. If and when we decide to
                charge for any services on the site, you will be notified at
                least 60 days in advance. We anticipate that if and when we
                start to charge for any services, there will always be certain
                services that remain free.

                TheLocalMusicFinder.com allows both bands and venues to post
                events. Even though they may post the same event, there could be
                slightly different information provided by each, so we leave
                both up to give you the most information possible.
